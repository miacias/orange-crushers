# <Outdoor-Excursion>


## Description

Is it time to get outside, but you're not sure where to go? Do you need to "touch grass" but need some inspiration? Explore our U.S. National Park system! Here, you can get crucial park information on how to plan ahead for your future visit or run out the door right now. Discover pertinent travel details right from where you are.

The motivation behind this project is to help people who live in or who visit the United States connect (or reconnect) with the great outdoors. Travelers from abroad, newly settled families, and even established folks oftentimes shy away from the amazing natural world right at our fingertips despite wanting to go on an excursion.

This project was founded by three creators: Mia, Mike, and Josh. We learned how to follow Agile workflow.

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Installation

N/A. [Deployed site here!](https://miacias.github.io/outdoor-excursion)


## Usage

The opening screen welcomes users to explore United States National Parks. The navigation sidebar contains controls while the main page shows a carousel of enticing nature-filled images from the nation's parks.

As the user reads the page, they are alerted with a tooltip on a button to first save their map key supplied by Google Maps.

To use:
1. Type or paste in a Google Maps API key into the input field then click "Save." This box should disappear from view once the key is saved. NOTE: If a mistake is made, you can refresh the page to return this box to view and input a new key.
2. Now that a Google Maps API key is saved, return to the top of the navigation sidebar.
3. Input a starting address.
4. Select a state of interest.
5. Select a park of interest.
6. Click "GO" to open up a map and access more info!
7. After viewing the map and manipulating it as desired, click the "More Details" button for details on the park and travel.

Search in any park and any state, just be sure to add in your starting address!

The main page looks like this:

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
	1. Now fill in the details as much as you can, referring to the following tips as you go:
	‚Ä¢ Remember that # in markdown is the top-level header, which is typically the title of the page. You can create your own title. For our example purposes, we will use ‚ÄúPrework Study Guide Webpage‚Äù.
 # Prework Study Guide Webpage
	‚Ä¢ Next, ## in markdown is a subheading. We have several subheadings in this README.
	‚Ä¢ For ## Description, write a short description of the Prework Study Guide Webpage. Use the guiding questions to help you.
	‚Ä¢ We don't have a long README, so you can delete the ## Table of Contents section.
	‚Ä¢ For ## Installation, we don‚Äôt have any steps to take to install anything for our webpage, so write ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù for this section.
	‚Ä¢ For ## Usage, write a short paragraph about how this Prework Study Guide can be used. For example, you can write about how each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. For now, we don't need to add an image, so you can delete that part.
	‚Ä¢ For ## Credits, we didn‚Äôt collaborate with others nor did we use any third-party assets or tutorials, so we can write ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢ For ## License, keep the MIT license that we chose when we first created the repository.
	‚Ä¢ The rest of the sections don‚Äôt apply to us, but feel free to take a look.
