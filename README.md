## License

Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
	1. Now fill in the details as much as you can, referring to the following tips as you go:
	‚Ä¢ Remember that # in markdown is the top-level header, which is typically the title of the page. You can create your own title. For our example purposes, we will use ‚ÄúPrework Study Guide Webpage‚Äù.
 # Prework Study Guide Webpage
	‚Ä¢ Next, ## in markdown is a subheading. We have several subheadings in this README.
	‚Ä¢ For ## Description, write a short description of the Prework Study Guide Webpage. Use the guiding questions to help you.
	‚Ä¢ We don't have a long README, so you can delete the ## Table of Contents section.
	‚Ä¢ For ## Installation, we don‚Äôt have any steps to take to install anything for our webpage, so write ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù for this section.
	‚Ä¢ For ## Usage, write a short paragraph about how this Prework Study Guide can be used. For example, you can write about how each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. For now, we don't need to add an image, so you can delete that part.
	‚Ä¢ For ## Credits, we didn‚Äôt collaborate with others nor did we use any third-party assets or tutorials, so we can write ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢ For ## License, keep the MIT license that we chose when we first created the repository.
	‚Ä¢ The rest of the sections don‚Äôt apply to us, but feel free to take a look.
